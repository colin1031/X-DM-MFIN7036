## Introduction

This project investigates the relationship between the daily return and 30-day volatility of Ripple and tweets posted on Twitter in the previous day. As for the underlying asset, Ripple was selected instead of the more famous Bitcoin for two reasons: Ripple’s tweets are easier to process due to fewer meaningless Twitter mentions, and Ripple has a stronger susceptibility to public opinion.
